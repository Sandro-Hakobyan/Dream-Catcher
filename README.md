The Dream Catcher app is super easy to use. Just follow these steps:

2. Click the "Catch" button and watch as the app generates three different ways to achieve your dream goal, each with a difficulty level. Pick the one that resonates with you the most, or that makes you feel the most excited.

## Technologies Used

We used some pretty amazing technologies to make the Dream Catcher app as dreamy and magical as possible:

1. ReactJS (because it's the perfect framework to catch your dreams!)
2. OpenAI GPT-3 API (the magic wand that turns dreams into reality)
3. CSS (because dreams are always better with a little bit of style and flair!)
4. COFFEE (I am programmer, and it was late night, i think there is no way ;)
